What started as an average day in Gander, Newfoundland turned into a historic moment when 38 planes carrying thousands of people were diverted there on September 11, 2001. Cultures clashed and nerves ran high, but the East Coast community welcomed these “come from aways” into their lives with open arms; uneasiness turned into trust, and gratitude grew into enduring friendships. Come From Away tells a heartwarming story of kindness in the face of unprecedented circumstances.

What started 17 years ago as a wild idea in the middle of a Canadian winter has snowballed into a full-blown national phenomenon — now the biggest comedy tour in Canada. This year, the laughs roll coast-to-coast across 70 cities, bringing world-class comedy straight to your backyard. And the fun doesn’t stop there. Starting October 11th, you can catch the Snowed In crew on Chek TV every Saturday night, and a few days later on YouTube (Oct 14th) with their brand-new laugh-out-loud series. (https://www.youtube.com/@snowedincomedy) Follow them as they dive into five unforgettable tour stops, capped off with their side-splitting stand-up specials. The lineup? Nothing short of powerhouse. Dan Quinn – Just for Laughs winner and tour founder. Paul Myrehaug – Great Canadian Laugh Off Pete Zedlacher – 6-time Canadian Comedian of the Year Erica Sigurdson – beloved Debaters regular with over 70 appearances. Four international comics. One stage. A blizzard of laughs. Critics call it “Better than the Just for Laughs Tour” and “A Flurry of Laughs You Can’t Miss.” Don’t just get through winter — laugh your way through it with the Snowed In Comedy [&hellip;]"

For the past 15 years, Dwayne Gretzky has developed a fervent fanbase across Canada solely on the strength of their live show – performing timeless classic hits with faithful precision, and breathtaking energy not seen in these songs since the original artists in their prime. This culminated in the band headlining one of Toronto’s biggest outdoor venues, Budweiser Stage, to over 7000 people in the summer of 2025. Also in summer 2025, the band launched their new Youtube series, Dwayne’s World, which has gone viral and caught the attention of music fans globally, expanding their audience through the world."

This engaging art class is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists who want to improve their drawing skills in a friendly, creative environment. The session begins with light warm-up activities before moving into still life drawing using real-life subjects. Instead of focusing on perfect accuracy, this workshop encourages you to loosen up, gain confidence in your mark-making, and enjoy the mindful process of looking closely at what you draw. All art materials, including markers, pastels, charcoal, and pencils, are provided. Participants are also welcome to bring their own supplies. You can even bring a small personal object to add to the still life arrangement, making your artwork unique and personal. If you’re looking for fun and inspiring art classes in Charlottetown or across PEI, this sketch workshop is a great place to start."

This engaging art class is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists who want to improve their drawing skills in a friendly, creative environment. The session begins with light warm-up activities before moving into still life drawing using real-life subjects. Instead of focusing on perfect accuracy, this workshop encourages you to loosen up, gain confidence in your mark-making, and enjoy the mindful process of looking closely at what you draw. All art materials, including markers, pastels, charcoal, and pencils, are provided. Participants are also welcome to bring their own supplies. You can even bring a small personal object to add to the still life arrangement, making your artwork unique and personal. If you’re looking for fun and inspiring art classes in Charlottetown or across PEI, this sketch workshop is a great place to start. Instructor:  Andreas Fobes is a filmmaker and educator originally from Ottawa, Ontario. He holds a BFA from Mount Allison University and an MA in Animation from the University of the West of England. As the Visual Arts Educator, he works to make both creating and experiencing visual art engaging, accessible, and fun [&hellip;]"

One of CBC’s The Debaters’ fan-favorites; people are often surprised at the raw nature of Derek’s stand-up… and how short he is. If you haven’t seen him live before; come out and discover the many hilarious surprises that his in-person shows are renowned for. No subject is off limits and no rabbit hole too deep. *Please be advised this performance contains frequent use of strong language and is intended for mature audiences.

Set in a bustling café, the performance follows a down-on-his-luck screenwriter who reunites with an old friend—sparking a whirlwind conversation about story arcs, artistic purpose, and the blockbuster tales that have shaped our culture. As their banter unfolds, a full orchestra brings their imagination to life with music from some of Hollywood’s most beloved scores. Created by Jaelem Bhate, award-winning conductor-composer and Music Director of the PEI Symphony Orchestra, this genre-bending production features iconic themes from Harry Potter, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Avengers, and more.

Whether you’re a film buff, music lover, or just someone who’s ever wrestled with their own creative voice, this unique concert-theatre hybrid will leave you laughing, reflecting— and maybe even inspired to write your own next chapter.

What started 17 years ago as a wild idea in the middle of a Canadian winter has snowballed into a full-blown national phenomenon — now the biggest comedy tour in Canada. This year, the laughs roll coast-to-coast across 70 cities, bringing world-class comedy straight to your backyard. And the fun doesn’t stop there. Starting October 11th, you can catch the Snowed In crew on Chek TV every Saturday night, and a few days later on YouTube (Oct 14th) with their brand-new laugh-out-loud series. (https://www.youtube.com/@snowedincomedy) Follow them as they dive into five unforgettable tour stops, capped off with their side-splitting stand-up specials. The lineup? Nothing short of powerhouse. Dan Quinn – Just for Laughs winner and tour founder. Paul Myrehaug – Great Canadian Laugh Off Pete Zedlacher – 6-time Canadian Comedian of the Year Erica Sigurdson – beloved Debaters regular with over 70 appearances. Four international comics. One stage. A blizzard of laughs. Critics call it “Better than the Just for Laughs Tour” and “A Flurry of Laughs You Can’t Miss.” Don’t just get through winter — laugh your way through it with the Snowed In Comedy [&hellip;]"

This engaging art class is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists who want to improve their drawing skills in a friendly, creative environment. The session begins with light warm-up activities before moving into still life drawing using real-life subjects. Instead of focusing on perfect accuracy, this workshop encourages you to loosen up, gain confidence in your mark-making, and enjoy the mindful process of looking closely at what you draw. All art materials, including markers, pastels, charcoal, and pencils, are provided. Participants are also welcome to bring their own supplies. You can even bring a small personal object to add to the still life arrangement, making your artwork unique and personal. If you’re looking for fun and inspiring art classes in Charlottetown or across PEI, this sketch workshop is a great place to start. Instructor:  Andreas Fobes is a filmmaker and educator originally from Ottawa, Ontario. He holds a BFA from Mount Allison University and an MA in Animation from the University of the West of England. As the Visual Arts Educator, he works to make both creating and experiencing visual art engaging, accessible, and fun [&hellip;]"

This holiday season, the men are back with your favourite re-imagined classics, brand-new originals from their December Coal Christmas album, and stories that’ll land somewhere in between your heart and your funny bone. Special guest vocalist and recording artist Jenn Sheppard joins the jolly miners on stage, along with her sharp-witted alter ego, Ellsa, who brings just the right touch of cranky Christmas chaos. Come for the music. Stay for the stories. It’s not just a concert, it’s a connection. “The most amazing concert I have ever been to!” — Sandra M., Guysborough, N.S. “Best show I have seen in a long time!! So very talented. I enjoyed every minute of it. Thank you!” — Lynn MacLellan, Cape Breton “The men sing with so much passion, making every concert a heartfelt night of song and stories that is so enjoyable!” — Jean &amp; [&hellip;]"

This is an ode to the countless hours needed to achieve great things. A tribute to the dedication required to realize our physical ambitions. An acknowledgement of the backstory that is often more spectacular than the finished product.  Eight world class acrobats investigate physical skill; how we obtain it, how we perfect it, and how it can transform our lives. Demonstrating high-flying flips and tricks, they will show the audience a greater appreciation of acrobatics and the dedication it takes to become a master of the form!  Gravity &amp; Other Myths is a circus company with roots in Adelaide, Australia. After forming in 2009 as a group of young artists with a passion for circus and physical theatre, they’ve spent the past 13 years growing steadily and creating six critically acclaimed main stage works.  This is a love letter to our bodies and the amazing things they let us do every day. This is an invitation to watch us work.     Created by: Director: Lachlan Binns  Associate Director: Darcy Grant Set &amp; Lighting Designer: Chris Petredis Assistant Designer: Max Mackenzie Composer: Nick Martin, [&hellip;]"

What started as an average day in Gander, Newfoundland turned into a historic moment when 38 planes carrying thousands of people were diverted there on September 11, 2001. Cultures clashed and nerves ran high, but the East Coast community welcomed these “come from aways” into their lives with open arms; uneasiness turned into trust, and gratitude grew into enduring friendships. Come From Away tells a heartwarming story of kindness in the face of unprecedented circumstances.

This Canadian classic is a humorous, touching, and dynamic musical that will inspire your imagination, tickle your funny bone, and mesmerize you with its graceful and exhilarating singing and dancing. This cherished family musical tells the poignant and funny story of a freckle-faced, red-haired orphan named Anne Shirley who arrives at the Bright River Railway Station full of hope for a new life. Her destination is the home of brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island. When she arrives at Green Gables, Anne is devastated when she discovers that the elderly couple is expecting a boy from the orphanage, and then ecstatic when they decide to keep her. With her fiery temper, love of melodrama and romance, and penchant for misadventure, she brings laughter, love, and more than a little consternation to the Cuthberts&#8217; quiet lives. In return, Anne finds the happiness and the home she has longed for all her life. With a 28-member company and [&hellip;]"

On Sunday, December 3 at 2:30 p.m., the Confederation Singers, orchestra, and four guest soloists perform Handel’s Messiah, the Baroque-era oratorio that celebrates the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Written in 1741, Messiah is the most famous creation of German composer George Frederic Handel, and its performance still awes listeners more than 250 years after the composer’s death. Ludwig van Beethoven himself, citing Messiah, said that Handel was the “greatest composer that ever lived.” The concert is an annual tradition at Confederation Centre of the Arts, led by Choral Music Director Donald Fraser. Joining the Centre’s adult choir this year are guest vocalists: mezzo-soprano Hannah O’Donnell, soprano Shannon Scales, baritone Parker Clements, and tenor James Smith. Scales and Clements, both Islanders, have previously performed Messiah with the Centre’s Choral Programme, while this marks the debut performance for fellow Islander, Hannah O’Donnell. Also making his first performance with the Centre is James Smith, a tenor from Des Moines, Iowa currently completely his Master’s of […]"

Ludwig van Beethoven himself, citing Messiah, said Handel was the “greatest composer that ever lived.” Sponsored by Maritime Electric, the concert is an annual tradition at Confederation Centre of the Arts, led by Choral Music Director Donald Fraser. Joining the Centre’s adult choir, the Confederation Singers, this year are four guest vocalists, well known in the choral community: mezzo-soprano Hannah O’Donnell, soprano Shannon Scales, baritone Parker Clements, and tenor James Smith.    The Confederation Singers include more than 60 members from across the community.

The ‘Women in Performance’ Series is the first program and takes place this Saturday, May 4 from 7 to 9 p.m. This event will include the following live performances: Donnalee Downe, who is presenting Sit Down with Downe, an interactive durational performance in the Gallery’s Recharge Lounge; Sandi Hartling in a durational ambient piece called How many variations does it take?; and, Sarah Wendt and Pascal Dufaux in a live performance piece entitled The mountains move while my fingernails grow.

The short films are shot in an almost nature documentary style in landscapes of barren rocks and cliff-faces in the strange and fantastical scenery of the Tablelands, in Gros Morne, Newfoundland.

The Centre and Holland College will welcome guest artists Eldiyar Daniyarov, Sion Irwin-Childs, Claire Newbery and Dawn Ward, to guide dancers through a series of workshops designed to hone dance, choreographic, and technical performance skills. A public performance will also be offered on February 29 at the Florence Simmons Performance Hall—admission by donation. During the two day series Daniyarov will share his extensive experience as a professional ballet dancer; Irwin-Childs will focus on instilling dancers with confidence in their choreography; and Ward will bring Afro-Jazz influences to her masterclasses. Director of Arts Education at the Centre, Peggy Reddin sees this initiative as a community-builder for dance on P.E.I.  describing WinterDance as “an alternative to dance events that are competition-based. WinterDance is aimed to celebrate and enjoy the art of dance for its own sake.” Newbery is a SopA graduate who is continuing her studies at Concordia University. She will guide senior level students through improvisation. […]"

The Maud will be hosted by Aaron Reid Ryder, who is currently performing in The Play That Goes Wrong and MAGGIE at The Charlottetown Festival. “As an Islander, I’m delighted to be part of this beloved tradition.

Audiences can expect unique performances from some of their favourite Festival performers.” The Maud Whitmore Benefit Concert raises money for the Maud Whitmore Scholarship Fund at The Charlottetown Festival. These scholarships help theatre artists, both emerging and established, pursue professional training […]"

The Maud sera animé par Aaron Reid Ryder, qui joue actuellement dans The Play That Goes Wrong et MAGGIE au Festival de Charlottetown. « En tant qu'Insulaire, je suis ravi de faire partie de cette tradition bien-aimée. Le Maud donne aux artistes l'occasion de présenter d'autres facettes de leur répertoire, ce qui en fait un spectacle mémorable et plein de surprises », dit-il. « Le Maud est également une importante collecte de fonds et une occasion pour nos artistes et la communauté d'aider à encourager le développement des talents du théâtre canadien. Le public peut s’attendre à des performances uniques de la part de certains de leurs artistes préférés du Festival. Le concert-bénéfice Maud Whitmore permet de récolter des fonds pour le fonds de bourses d'études Maud Whitmore au Festival de Charlottetown. Ces bourses aident les artistes de théâtre, émergents et confirmés, à poursuivre une formation professionnelle […]"

After performing the hit show The Songs of Johnny & June at The 2023 Charlottetown Festival, Islanders Jacob Hemphill and Melissa MacKenzie will return in main stage roles this summer. Hemphill is set to take on the part of Nick Massi in Jersey Boys, a member of the famed group The Four Seasons.

Other Island-based company members include Sarah Bell, Jessica Burrett, and Kristen Pottle. “We are proud to continually feature Island talent on our stages alongside artists from across the country,” says Adam Brazier, the Centre’s artistic director of performing arts. “There is a lot of excitement around the Festival lineup, and we are looking forward to another great summer in Charlottetown.” The Centre previously announced that actors Kelsey Verzotti […]"

With 21 studio albums, 8 JUNO Awards, 31 Maple Blues Awards, and multiplatinum sales, James remains at the top of his game — a master guitarist and soulful performer whose work bridges blues, rock, and roots music. His newest release, Chasing the Sun, is an electrifying testament to that artistry. Coproduced with Colin Linden, the album features an extraordinary roster of guest musicians, including Americana icon Lucinda Williams, Rolling Stones bassist Darryl Jones, drummer Charley Drayton, blues legend Charlie Musselwhite, and gospel greats Ann and Regina McCrary. The result is a vibrant, deeply personal record that celebrates musical connection and craft. Over three decades, James has created a career rich with milestones — from his 1988 breakout hits “Voodoo Thing” and “Five Long Years,” to launching the swing revival with his Little Big Band, to award-winning blues albums like Open Road and Blue Highways. He’s collaborated with icons such as Bonnie Raitt, Buddy Guy, and Keith Richards, and continues to sell out theatres and festivals worldwide.

Known for its organic and pastoral themes, his second symphony is a story of a composer in full bloom, overcoming personal struggle in the name of their art. The orchestra welcomes back mezzo soprano Hannah O’Donnell as soloist in Berlioz’s Les nuites d’éte (Summer Nights), preceded by Zoltán Kodály’s street music inspired Dances of Galánta."

A choir of retired coal miners, they preserve and celebrate a unique way of life, sharing the songs and stories they’ve lived through first-hand. This holiday season, the men are back with your favourite re-imagined classics, brand-new originals from their December Coal Christmas album, and stories that’ll land somewhere in between your heart and your funny bone. Special guest vocalist and recording artist Jenn Sheppard joins the jolly miners on stage, along with her sharp-witted alter ego, Ellsa, who brings just the right touch of cranky Christmas chaos. Come for the music. Stay for the stories. It’s not just a concert, it’s a connection. “The most amazing concert I have ever been to!” — Sandra M., Guysborough, N.S. “Best show I have seen in a long time!! So very talented. I enjoyed every minute of it. Thank you!” — Lynn MacLellan, Cape Breton “The men sing with so much passion, making every concert a heartfelt night of song and stories that is so enjoyable!” — Jean &amp; [&hellip;]"

This show will feature more of his hilarious stories on the challenges of relationships with his girlfriend, his three nearly grown-up children and every-day life in a mixed-up world that he finds peculiar at best. With barely a moment to catch your breath between laughs there is never a dull moment in Derek’s shows and for 20 years audiences have loved him for it, but he loves you more! One of CBC’s The Debaters’ fan-favorites; people are often surprised at the raw nature of Derek’s stand-up… and how short he is. If you haven’t seen him live before; come out and discover the many hilarious surprises that his in-person shows are renowned for. No subject is off limits and no rabbit hole too deep. *Please be advised this performance contains frequent use of strong language and is intended for mature audiences.

They will explore the work of Andy Warhol in light of contemporary digital practice, and consider what art means in an age of fictionless sharing and the “experience economy.” “This promises to be a new kind of art talk, featuring a conversation between a social media researcher/expert and a skyped-in artist, and a discussion about art that really comes from a fresh angle,” says Pan Wendt, Art Gallery Curator for Confederation Centre of the Arts. Presented by P.E.I.-based Bonnie Stewart, Digital Identity Researcher and Daniel Lynds, Art Instructional Designer and Interdisciplinary Artist based in North Carolina, the event is timed to coincide with the exhibition Gretzky is Everywhere, that presents Warhol’s famous print at multiple sites simultaneously via livestream: in Charlottetown, at the Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton, and at The Rooms in St. John’s. The presenters will take participants through an exploration of contemporary remix culture, memes, and up/down voting of content….via Andy Warhol.

Sponsored by Key Murray Law, the bittersweet Canadian musical is playing a short run at the Centre’s cabaret theatre, The Mack, until Sept 22. Adapted from a short story by Anton Chekhov, the musical starts with two old friends going for a walk in the woods. Their conversation soon takes a turn, revealing hidden depths to their relationship and forcing them to question the lives they’ve chosen. “Despite being written over a hundred years ago, the play’s themes are timeless,” says Kevin Michael Shea, scriptwriter and musical co-creator. “We’ve all loved the wrong people, or not loved the right people enough.” A Misfortune promises audiences a romantic, bittersweet musical about small moments and momentous decisions. Set at a dinner party among friends, sordid secrets are revealed with every shot of vodka.

In Remembrance takes place Saturday, November 11, at 7:30 p.m. at Trinity United Church in Charlottetown. “In Remembrance offers an evening of thought-provoking poetry complemented by appropriate selections of choral music. One reflects and heightens the other,” says Don Fraser, director of music at the Confederation Centre of the Arts. “Much of the poetry is from the First World War, and included in the music is a Canadian choral setting of the famous In Flanders Fields poem.” The concert will also feature I’m Dreaming of Home that members of the Youth Chorus performed at the dedication ceremony for the newly restored Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France on April 9, 2007, the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. Other pieces of music include Bruckner’s Locus Iste, Eleanor Daley’s In Remembrance, Calling my Children Home arranged by Joseph Jennings, the beautiful Pie Jesu by Fauré and the beautiful Ubi Caritas of Ola Gjeilo. Tickets for the annual In Remembrance performance are $15 and are available at the door or at […]"

Filled with romance and drama, the story takes on an unexpected twist with a surprise ending. It sounds like a journey that we can all connect to in one way or another.

Hot flashes and night sweats can be annoying, but finding the humour in the experience can make it a little bit better. That is where Menopause The Musical comes in. It’s a show that celebrates women on the brink of “the change” and those who’ve survived it.

The show takes liberties with classic hits – turning the Bee Gees’ Staying Alive into Staying Awake – and audiences will leave with their faces hurting from laughing so much. Co-producer Mark Zimmerman describes why there is a need to have a musical about menopause, “At one time this is a topic that people didn’t discuss, but we bring it to life with this show through comedy.” Zimmerman goes on to explain, “By the end, the women in the audience form a sisterhood.” Spoiler alert…the cast […]"

Langlois, who hails from Quebec, spent many years on Prince Edward Island before moving to Moncton, N.B. He is deeply involved in the cultural and musical scene in both provinces. Langlois also has published two books of poetry at Éditions Perce-Neige: Mener du train (2010) and La rue en eaux troubles (2012), and a novel, Le trésor de Memramcook. Creeggan is a founding member of Barenaked Ladies along with his brother Jim. The pair also released four albums as The Brothers Creeggaan. After being accepted into the Faculty of Music at McGill University, Creeggan went on to pursue instrumental music, focusing on theory and composition, and now lives in Moncton, N.B. Creeggan’s three solo works: Andiwork, Andiwork II, and Andiwork III, are largely instrumental pieces that consist of more contemporary classical, with touches of jazz and rock.

Land created the paintings over the last decade; to mark Canada’s sesquicentennial, Land has been inspired to present the collection of paintings and prose reflections representing the floral emblem of each province and territory along with a painting entitled “Canadian Unity.” “Each provincial and territorial flower conveys its own unique character, and together they represent the best of Canada,” says Land. “It is my hope that this exhibit will serve to inspire and re-energize Canadians as they reflect on these values we share as the community of Canada.” Land will be attending the opening reception and will also be present at the exhibition December 15 and 17 from 1- 4 p.m. to talk to visitors about her project. -30- Photo cutline: Flowers of Canada, is a part of Mary Margaret Land’s exhibition which opens December 14 and runs until 22 in the Centre’s concourse.

A tribute to Wright’s mother Shawn spent the final months of his mother’s life travelling from Toronto to her nursing home in the Maritimes to spend as much time with her as he could before she passed. During these visits, she would spin stories of her life during the commercial breaks of her favourite TV show, Murder She Wrote. Wright chronicled these stories and developed a hilarious and poignant story about the relationship between mother and son, growing up in New Brunswick the youngest of seven children, and, most importantly, as a tribute to his mother for giving him his love of life. “She is the reason that I am an actor,” says Wright. “She used acting in community theatre as a break from motherhood.

Earlier this year she won the SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award with MusicPEI and has been on The Charlottetown Festival main stage for the past six seasons.

An intimate concert presentation starring Adam Brazier and Josée Boudreau, plus a full accompanying cast and orchestra, is based on a true story from 16th century France and explores what limits an individual confronts to follow their heart. The original book was written by Leslie Arden and Anna Theresa Cascio, and then adapted to music and lyrics by Leslie Arden. The story follows a young peasant girl named Bertrande who is forced to marry the abusive Martin Guerre.  After years of unhappy marriage, he abandons her and their son; but years later a stranger returns claiming to be Martin Guerre.

The school offers instruction in a wide range of dance styles for children,  young people, and adults, such as creative movement, ballet, jazz, contemporary, afro-jazz, hip-hop, tap, and musical theatre. Registration for 2018-2019 classes are now open with classes starting on September 10, 2018.  Founders Peggy Reddin and Julia Sauvé established dance umbrella in 1988 with the vision to make a more inclusive and collaborative dance community. For the past 30 years, dance umbrella has strived to highlight dance as an enriching art form that helps build self-confidence, create healthy bodies and minds, and develop creativity. Thousands of students have gone through its training programmes, many of whom have successful careers in the arts. Students under the programme have the opportunity to perform in works outside the context of school recitals and increased opportunity to work with other artists in the community. Notable collaborations have included the National Ballet School and the Prince Edward Island Symphony Orchestra. “One of my favourite memories from my years with dance umbrella is when we put on “The Nutcracker” with […]"

On the Road with Dutch Mason and Stories from the Red Dirt Road both made world premieres at The Mack this summer, drawing accolades from patrons and critics alike. Confederation Centre is offering a closing promo for these must-see productions. The Bringin’-it-Home Sale grants patrons 40% off tickets until closing nights, September 21 and 22, respectively. Patrons need only quote promo code ‘mack40’ when booking online or at the Centre’s box office. Both musicals feature plentiful East Coast flavour. On the Road with Dutch Mason is inspired by true events and is peppered with quirky characters that patrons will find familiar and comical. Based on the book by David Bedford and Harvey Sawler, Dutch Mason was written and adapted by Festival favourite Wade Lynch and stars Charlottetown’s own John Connolly as the famous Halifax bluesman. “It’s been an honour to perform as Dutch Mason with an incredible cast this summer,” reflects Connolly. “There is tremendous affection for him that audiences shared with us during every performance and post-show.” […]"

Boudreau, known for her celebrated turn as the titular heroine in Evangeline, will portray Bertrande, a peasant woman deserted by her angry husband of arranged marriage, Martin Guerre. Bertrande and their son are shocked when Guerre – played by Brazier – returns eight years later to assume his position as head of household. He presents himself as a changed man, transformed into a caring partner; however, community members denounce him as an impostor. Guerre is jailed and sent to trial and Bertrande is forced to consider how far she will go to follow her heart. This concert performance is directed by Mary Francis Moore, Festival associate artistic director, with musical direction by Wayne Gwillim.

Guest DJ Will Yarr of Halifax will set the beat, while ridiculous costumes, projections, and the ever-popular Spinning Wheel of Fortune Cookie will intrigue partygoers around every turn, occupying all levels of the Centre gallery. Among other light-hearted activities, there are even rumours about carpentry! The event includes an interactive video game, and work by artists Kelly Caseley, Pascal Dufaux, Rebecca Ford, Ian Funke-McKay, Evan Furness, Eric Gaucher, Sandi Hartling, and Mikey Woz, among others.

The troubadour brings her national tour to Charlottetown this month, helping to launch the 10th anniversary season of Sobeys LIVE @ the Centre, Confederation Centre’s fall and winter concert series. Evolving over the course of many albums from folk to jazz, R & B to pop, Barber’s success is defined not by genre, but by her undeniable songwriting chops and distinctive voice. Now, the B.C.-based artist is bursting into the world of contemporary pop with her latest release, Metaphora. The result is a “Jill Barber like you’ve never heard before,” says a spokesperson for the songstress. “These nine songs are a showcase of Jill’s power and vulnerability as both an artist and a woman. They are introspective, personal, and are, also, an absolute dance party.” Metaphora is a continuation of Barber’s musical story, tackling such issues as the complications of love, empowerment, sexual politics, and depression. It was mutual friend and musician, Hannah Georgas, who introduced Barber to Ryan Guldemond, the enigmatic lead singer of Canadian band, Mother Mother. Serendipitously, Guldemond lives just a […]"

After a busy 2017 season that saw two troupes crisscross the country, the 2018 company has been invited to perform at the Future of Child Welfare in Canada: National Child Welfare Conference 2018, October 23 to 26 in Calgary, Alberta. The conference is a Canadian first that brings together the Provincial and Territorial Directors of Child Welfare with the Annual Prairie Child Welfare Consortium conference, and the University of Calgary’s Faculty of Social Work. A central theme is the need to address child welfare within an Indigenous context and to consider ways to move forward in light of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations. It is estimated that nearly half of Canadian children in foster care, under the age of 14 are Indigenous, and that, overall, Indigenous children comprise 30 to 40 percent of children in care. Thanks to the generous support of Indigenous Services Canada, Confederation Centre is bringing 11 company members to Calgary, all of whom appeared in The Charlottetown Festival production of Aqsarniit (“awe-saw-nee”) this summer. These young artists come from across Canada […]"

QSO is a 12-piece chamber group dedicated to sharing queer narratives through the performance of pop music from the past century. The Toronto-based ensemble source their stories from the personal experiences of LGBTQ individuals and the songs that have meant most to them. Building bridges, one set-list at a time Carrying the belief that storytelling and song are powerful communicators that can increase understanding and foster community, QSO have been bringing this vulnerability to stages across Canada since 2014. By working with a base of familiar pop songs offered alongside queer narratives, the listener is shown a new entry point into familiar music. For this show, songs like Blondie‘s ‘Heart of Glass’, Arcade Fire‘s ‘Sprawl II’, and David Bowie‘s ‘Changes’ have been reinterpreted by a team of skilled arrangers.

The approximately 500 photographs Meigs took in New Freedom became source material for a series of modestly scaled paintings, The Basement Piles, and a catalyst for the more monumental The Basement Panoramas, which are each based on real basements whose locations are named in their titles. “In Meigs’ paintings, the physical shape of the basement breaks down into vigorous spirals and swirling lines, spreading and changing direction as if of their own accord,” offers Gallery Curator, Pan Wendt.

On Thursday, April 4 the LaboKracBoom Circus Company brings together its distinctive combination of circus, dance, and physical theatre with this new creation. Based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Chute Libre is a great show for the whole family, presenting a highly physical performance that fuses circus arts, contemporary dance, and theatre. Five featured artists play with risk, trust, gravity, and tension. Imagine a combination of contemporary dance, parkour, partner acrobatics, Chinese pole, aerial hoop, and live music…all in a 60-minute show! Presented as part of Sobeys LIVE @ the Centre, this “Pay What You Will” performance works exactly how it sounds! Attendees still need to book seats by visiting the Centre box office, calling, or booking online, but, at the end of the performance, patrons are asked to submit any amount they wish by using a provided envelope. Chute Libre hits at the Homburg Theatre on April 4 at 6 p.m., a slightly earlier show than normal. For more information, please visit the Confederation […]"

Confederation Centre of the Arts welcomes the much-celebrated touring act for its second performance of the Sobeys LIVE @ the Centre 2018-19 season, taking to the Homburg stage this Saturday April 6 at 7:30 p.m. This must-see show is sponsored by Charlottetown Inn & Conference Services. A perennial Centre must-see, Classic Albums Live presents skilled musicians recreating the greatest albums of the ’60s and ’70s live on stage—note for note, cut for cut.

This Canadian classic is a humorous, touching, and dynamic musical that will inspire your imagination, tickle your funny bone, and mesmerize you with its graceful and exhilarating singing and dancing. This cherished family musical tells the poignant and funny story of a freckle-faced, red-haired orphan named Anne Shirley who arrives at the Bright River Railway Station full of hope for a new life.

This Halifax-based band blends 90s alt-rock influences and singer-songwriter stylings for songs that exploring all the things that make us human. The trio’s fourth full length album, Everything (will be fine when we get to where we think we’re going), shows a maturity brought on by hundreds of live shows around the world. Lyrically, at the root of every song is a passionate exploration of the things that make us all human: heartache, longing, society in the modern age, dreams, and family.  The album is simultaneously thought-provoking and irresistibly danceable and is up for both Group Recording and Songwriter of the Year at this year’s ECMA’s in Charlottetown.

While some Islanders are saying “Where did the summer go to?”,  there are still three weeks left to see the four productions playing at Confederation Centre of the Arts.

Sponsored by Tim Hortons, the blockbuster musical is an intoxicating experience, with big laughs and stunning design and choreography. “This year’s mainstage productions were definitely influenced by popular demand, with Kronborg and Mamma Mia! being the most requested shows by Islanders for years,” remarks Adam Brazier, artistic director at Confederation Centre. “We’re very pleased with the richness and variety of programming, […]"

Founded in 1989 to mark the 125th anniversary of the 1864 Charlottetown Conference, the Players program have offered historic vignettes, guided walking tours, Victorian songs, croquet games with tourists, and improvised street encounters to thousands and thousands of visitors in Downtown Charlottetown. More than 250 young people from across Canada have taken part in the youth leadership program to date. The troupe employs about a dozen young people from P.E.I. and elsewhere every summer and, since 2012, have been a key part of Confederation Centre of the Arts’ (CCOA) heritage and arts education offerings. CN came on board as major program sponsor in 2017, launching special Canada 150 and rail-themed celebrations with the Players in cities across Canada. Now, to highlight CN’s own 100th anniversary, the troupe will return to Ottawa and Montreal in the weeks ahead to perform on Parliament Hill and participate in centenary celebrations.

The Young Company is a long-standing pillar of arts education within the Centre’s Charlottetown Festival – sponsored by CIBC – and features 12 young artists from across Canada.

This electrifying staging of Shakespeare’s famous Hamlet was a breakthrough for Confederation Centre when it first premiered here in 1974, later becoming the first Canadian musical to ever play on Broadway. Originally written and conceived by Cliff Jones, the 2019 production promises to entrance a whole new generation of theatre-lovers. This epic rock’n’roll-powered production is directed by Mary Francis Moore with music direction from Craig Fair. “This new staging has been fully re-orchestrated and re-arranged musically by Craig Fair—new life breathed into a Canadian classic,” offers Moore. “The inspiration for these changes all come from the beautiful lyrics and melodies Cliff wrote 45 years ago.” See the full creative team in addendum and read full casting […]"

Set in Newfoundland in the early ‘80s, this one-man production brings to life a world of raucous adventures, death-defying escapades, and dubious childcare. The hilarious evening of story and song is a fictionalized biography written and performed by Festival favourite, Stephen Guy-McGrath (‘Bill’ in Mamma Mia!; ‘Sam Phillips’ in Million Dollar Quartet; ‘René in Evangeline). Sponsored by Key Murray Law/Meritas, the production runs July 20 to September 28 at Confederation Centre of the Arts. Featured are traditional Newfoundland fiddle tunes and well-loved songs such as ‘The St. John’s Waltz’ by Ron Hynes, ‘Wave over Wave’ by Jim Payne (popularized by Great Big Sea), and more. To learn a little more about this production, which Guy-McGrath has presented in multiple other theatres, Centre staff sat down with the author and performer himself for a ‘Q &A’: Question 1.  What is the origin story for ‘Spinning Yarns’?  Stephen: More than 20 years ago I was getting started in the industry and there were not a lot of opportunities for me, but I had lots […]"

Opening this Friday August 9, Mamma Mia! is sponsored by Tim Horton’s and plays until September 28 at Confederation Centre of the Arts. The high-spirited musical stars Rebecca Poff as single mother Donna and Katie Kerr as her only child, Sophie, who is also the bride-to-be in this sunny ABBA-driven tale. For Sophie’s wedding, Donna has invited her two lifelong best friends–practical and no-nonsense Rosie, and wealthy, multi-divorcée Tanya–from her one-time backing band, Donna and the Dynamos. Rosie is played by Festival favourite Nicola-Dawn Brook and stepping into the role of Tanya is Sara-Jeanne Hosie. The pride of Victoria, B.C., Hosie made her Festival debut earlier this summer in the much-acclaimed remount of Kronborg-The Hamlet Rock Musical and also as Miss Stacey in Anne of Green Gables—The Musical™. Hosie steps in for the Festival’s Susan Henley who had to withdraw due to injury. “This is my first […]"

For a sun- or star-lit dining experience, don’t pass up a visit to this architecturally significant space this summer. “With a beautiful garden, shady trees, waterfall, and all-day sun, I would say our courtyard is the best-kept secret in Charlottetown” says Mavor’s server/bartender Shelby Dixon, adding “we’re shielded from any wind and traffic noise, making it a little oasis in the middle of the downtown.” An oasis indeed, considering the brutalist architecture of Confederation Centre that surrounds this subterranean lush space. Built in 1963-1964, the Centre’s exterior is faced with solid, continuous walls of sandstone. Once used by the Confederation Centre Art Gallery to display public sculptures, the space has been landscaped and furnished to complement the architectural marvel of this National Historic Site of Canada. Take the stairs down from the concrete plaza off Grafton Street, and enjoy this unique atmosphere before the summer weather and patio furniture are packed away for another year."

The long-awaited two-gallery show will be open to the public on October 5 and officially celebrated—along with three other new exhibitions–at the Fall Art Gala on Friday, October 18 at the CCAG. The exhibition and its associated publication are sponsored by CN100. The exhibition features over 100 paintings from a career that spanned 35 years.

Mostly self-taught, although he did study briefly under Eric Fischl at NSCAD, Burke was a painter with a distinct personal style. His works addressed social roles, alienation, and the absurd in darkly humorous figurative images. “Brian Burke is still a local hero, but he was also someone who dealt with universal themes, and achieved international success,” explains Curator Pan Wendt. “He was a rare artist who both sold his work and achieved critical acclaim, and he was a painter’s painter, instantly recognized by his peers for his original and powerful vision.” […]"

An alumna of the TD Young Company, Bouey effectively grew up at the Centre, including years of dance recitals and drama festivals. The Sheridan College graduate will also appear in Anne of Green Gables—The Musical™ next summer, playing Prissy Andrews. Q1: Michelle, you’re coming home in 2020. What’s your favourite thing about a PEI summer? A: Seafood and the beach! I love being so close to some of the best beaches in the world and the sense of timelessness that goes with it. After a day at the beach it’s fun to have a drink with a friend, while listening to jazz on the Row. A classic Island experience is running into at least three people you know, almost anytime you walk around the downtown area. My favourite thing of all is being able to spend time with my family, who I don’t get to see as often as I’d like. Q2: Do you have a cherished Centre memory? […]"

Artists have often tried to address such questions in portraits of one another, and of themselves. An exhibition selected from the Confederation Centre Art Gallery (CCAG) permanent collection entitled Artists by Artists, which highlights these explorations, opens Saturday, January 18. The exhibition features the work of more than 30 visual artists, including photographic portraits by Lionel Stevenson, Dominique Cruchet, and Richard Furlong of Prince Edward Island artists Jack Turner, John Bradford MacCallum, Hilda Woolnough, Bill McFadden, and Nigel Roe. Also included is: a charcoal portrait of Donald Andrus by Bruno Bobak, Andrus’ portrait of Adam Sultan, Brian Burke‘s portrait of Libby Oughton, and a sculpture of legendary Quebecois artist Armand Vaillancourt by the late Carl Phillis.

Curated by Timothy Long and Julia Krueger, and organized by the MacKenzie Art Gallery (Calgary), The Gardener’s Universe brings together over 100 works that present a richly layered picture of Cicansky’s career, one that has been firmly rooted in his garden. Victor Cicansky: The Gardener’s Universe promises to engage visitors of all ages and will display in the Upper West Gallery at the CCAG until April 26, 2020. As part of a series of Art Talks, Evan Furness, visual arts educator, will introduce the Cicansky exhibition on February 20 from noon to 12:30 p.m. These talks are offered free-of-charge at the Gallery and all are welcome. For over 50 years, ideas for sculptures in ceramics and bronze have grown out of Cicansky’s intimate relationship with the plants and trees of his backyard. His approach embraces both the immigrant knowledge of his Romanian-Canadian family and more contemporary concerns around urban ecology and environmental sustainability. Grounded in local realities, his work speaks […]"

The public will have a chance to explore the new exhibitions, with a Winter Gallery Opening being held March 7 at 7 p.m. at Confederation Centre, a national arts centre and living memorial to the nation’s founding. All are welcome for the opening, a seasonal tradition, which is always a chance to experience the new works amidst a fun and social atmosphere.

Unfortunately, with the necessary restrictions on large gatherings and the need for social distancing remaining in place for some time, our ability is limited, not only to host audiences, but to prepare with rehearsals and construction in the months ahead of our performances”, says Bellamy. He continues, “We are truly saddened not to be able to share in the joy of live theatre together this season and I want to express to all of our members, partners, patrons, and artists that we cannot wait to celebrate the arts as a community again when the time is right.” Sponsored by CIBC, the Festival was slated to run from June 3 to September 26, […]"

The Symons Medal—one of Canada’s most prestigious honours—recognizes an individual who has made an exceptional contribution to Canadian life. Held each fall, the medal ceremony and its associated lecture offer a national platform for an eminent Canadian to discuss the nation’s current state, shared histories, and future prospects using themes related to their professional pursuits. The award is presented at Confederation Centre of the Arts—Canada’s living monument to Canadian Confederation—in honour of the meetings of the Fathers of Confederation, who first gathered at Province House National Historic Site in the fall of 1864. “On behalf of Professor Thomas H.B. Symons, for whom this lecture is named, and Confederation Centre CEO Steve Bellamy, we are elated to announce Mr. Bob Rae as the 2020 Recipient of the Symons Medal,” says Chair of the Fathers of Confederation Buildings Trust, Robert Sear. “Mr. Rae is the 20th Medallist in this series, following a formidable line of recipients such as […]"

This duality was celebrated in Wiebe’s VampSites, a national touring exhibition organized by the CCAG and curated by Pan Wendt, which is exhibiting at the Reach Gallery in Abbotsford, B.C. in 2021.   Wiebe’s Halifax studio–located above a navy surplus store and crammed with paintings, props, and found accessories–is the setting for this new FIELDTRIP project, an extended “video feedback” […]"

The first is an open-air concert series taking root in the Centre’s outdoor amphitheatre—the venue known to most as the regular home for the TD Young Company. For this new series, entitled Set in the Sun, a different Island songwriter or instrumental duo will perform a live concert on site, every Wednesday and Saturday at 5 p.m. Presented by program sponsor Honibe, Set in the Sun is part of a slate of programming being unrolled this summer under the banner, CIBC Confed Centre Presents. Another major announcement will be coming later this month around a digital series. Set in the Sun is a 12-part live series that highlights a thrilling cross-section of local talent, ranging from fiddle music to classical, to folk, rock, and hip-hop. Seating will be limited to 40 people per concert, with parties of up to four staggered safely throughout the venue. “The Centre team has been thrilled to reopen to the public over the past month, and now […]"

Making craft is a form of thinking, a communication across generations. In a new exhibition opening August 8 at the Confederation Centre Art Gallery (CCAG), Island artisans respond to the theme of ‘creative obsessions’ with innovative works drawing on craft traditions to mark Craft Year 2020. Creative Obsessions is organized by the CCAG in collaboration with the PEI Crafts Council, and is guest curated by Ray Cronin and Sarah Maloney. Fine craft has always demanded an element of obsession: the artist has to master varied techniques, often difficult materials, and do so in a manner that keeps them engaged in the long hours from conception to production, all the while striving to make something that viewers will find equally compelling. Success is never a given—failure is an all too familiar studio companion for every artist and craftsperson. Of course, it is often through failure that artists learn the most. Participating craftspeople in this new exhibition include: Jim Aquilani, Nancy Cole, Jamie Germaine, Arlene MacAusland, Rilla Marshall, […]"

This closure includes the Confederation Centre Art Gallery, the Confederation Centre Public Library, The Story of Confederation, and other arts education offerings. The remaining 2020 dance umbrella classes are cancelled, and the program will resume in the new year. The Centre’s two scheduled holiday concerts, Comfort & Joy (Dec. 20) and The East Pointers (part of Capital New Year, Dec. 30-31) are tentative at this time, pending updates from CPHO. Depending on the unfolding public health situation, one or both of these concerts may proceed and patrons are asked to hold on to their tickets and watch confederationcentre.com and Centre social media for updates in the next week. Patrons with ticketing questions can contact the Centre’s box office via email, boxoffice@confederationcentre.com. All Confederation Centre staff are still available via email and phone and are either working from home or safely on-site. Patrons are also reminded that year-end giving is still available at this time, with options to give online at confederationcentre.com/donate […]"

Ces dates coïncident avec le début de la semaine de relâche et les spectateurs sont invités à planifier leur célébration de la relâche par une soirée dans le grand théâtre, la salle joyau de la couronne de l’Î.-P.-É. « Nous sommes ravis que The East Pointers soient disponibles à ces dates et nous invitons les titulaires de billets à maintenir l’excitation de la veille du Nouvel An et à se joindre à nous pour célébrer, en toute sécurité, le début de la semaine de relâche, commente Darcy Campbell, directeur de @ l’affiche au Centre.

We are very optimistic these funds will help to bring venues and cultural centres back online and once again give these artists spaces to perform and create within.”   “We offer our gratitude to The Honourable Chrystia Freeland, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, and the federal government for offering this additional support at such a crucial time for the arts,” adds Bellamy. “We look forward […]"

The Symons Medal—one of Canada’s most prestigious honours—recognizes an individual who has made an exceptional contribution to Canadian life. The award and its associated lecture are presented annually at Confederation Centre of the Arts—Canada’s living monument to Canadian Confederation—in honour of the meetings of the Fathers of Confederation, who first gathered in Charlottetown in the fall of 1864. Each year since 2004, the Symons Committee, co-chaired by Robert Sear and George Kitching, selects a recipient from a list of outstanding nominees. “On behalf of Confederation Centre of the Arts and CEO Steve Bellamy, I am pleased to announce the Honourable Louise Arbour as the 21st Recipient of the Symons Medal,” states Sear, chair of the Fathers of Confederation Buildings Trust. “We look forward to welcoming Madame Arbour to Charlottetown this fall to share her perspective and reflect on a life spent in pursuit of civil justice for all, including her important work with the United Nations, the Supreme Court […]"

Sponsored by Key Murray Law, Dear Rita is a musical toast to ‘Cape Breton’s First Lady of Song’, celebrating the life, tenacity, and musical legacy of the late great, Rita MacNeil. Featuring a stellar cast of actor-musicians, an ace drummer, and Rita’s actual guitar player, Dear Rita is told through the direction of Associate Artistic Director Mary Francis Moore and a script by Cape Breton’s own Lindsay Kyte. This cabaret musical features new, re-imagined arrangements of Rita’s music by P.E.I. composer/musician (and musical co-creator), Mike Ross. Confederation Centre of the Arts is pleased to announce the show’s cast of performers, including: Michelle Bouey (Lovers’ Lament), Sheldon Elter (Métis Mutt; Evangeline), Kristi Hansen (Citadel Theatre), Melissa MacKenzie (Good Girl), and Festival favourite, Brendan Wall. Additional musical accompaniment is from guitar legend Chris Corrigan (P.E.I.), who in fact recorded and toured as Rita’s lead guitarist for many years; and drummer Trevor Grant. “We picked songs from Rita’s catalogue, from her popular hits to ones that made her bandmates weep, and created narratives around these to offer […]"

June 21 offers an opportunity for people of all backgrounds to celebrate the important contributions of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples. The Canadian Constitution recognizes these groups as Aboriginal peoples, also known as Indigenous peoples, and it is important to underline that each of these groups have their own distinct languages, cultural practices, and spiritual beliefs. Located in Epekwitk, home of the Abegweit and Lennox Island First Nations, Confederation Centre of the Arts is celebrating National Indigenous Peoples Day as we move through a period of institutional transformation. This transformation includes learning, listening, and taking action to recognize the truth of our shared history, dismantling the colonial identity of the Centre, and working toward reconciliation by responding to the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We are rebuilding the Centre on principles of inclusivity, anti-racism, and decolonization to become a place of learning and intercultural understanding. We are proud to […]"

Art was always an adventure into fun for us.” BGL (Jasmin Bilodeau, Sébastien Giguère, and Laverdière) is known for their amusing and critical look at our relationship with nature and disposable consumer culture.

Upon graduation, Pratt worked as a freelance photo editor for the Sunday Express, a newspaper published in Newfoundland from 1989-1991. In subsequent years his work appeared in the New York Times, Newsweek, MacLean’s, […]"

The production ran annually since the Festival’s launch in 1965 and is recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s longest-running annual musical. The Centre was unable to produce the show in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-related challenges but is thrilled to be bringing it back this summer. “We are so excited to welcome the Island’s most beloved orphan back to the stage next season,” says Adam Brazier, Artistic Director of Performing Arts. “The 2022 Festival will focus on stories from our region; stories that speak to east coast culture, resilience, and determination. No one epitomizes that more than Anne of Green Gables.” Sponsored by CAA Atlantic, the production is a quintessential part of the Island’s summer entertainment offering, and a cornerstone of the province’s tourism product.

Anne of Green Gables–The Musical™ will be one of two mainstage productions of the 2022 Charlottetown Festival, marking the first time the show will be staged since 2019. The production ran annually since the Festival’s launch in 1965 and is recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s longest-running annual musical. The Centre was unable to produce the show in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-related challenges but is thrilled to be bringing it back this summer. “We are so excited to welcome the Island’s most beloved orphan back to the stage next season,” says Adam Brazier, Artistic Director of Performing Arts. “The 2022 Festival will focus on stories from our region; stories that speak to east coast culture, resilience, and determination. No one epitomizes that more than Anne of Green Gables.” Sponsored by CAA Atlantic, the production is a quintessential part of the Island’s summer entertainment offering, and a cornerstone of the province’s tourism product. Premier Dennis King says Anne™ returning to the mainstage is […]"

The JUNO Award-winning multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter fuses afrobeat, reggae, and Haitian rara into a rich and energetic sound. Wesli and his band will deliver a festive and uniquely engaging performance at The Mack.  Hitting the mainstage on March 2 is Ballet Kelowna: MAMBO and Other Works. Performed by one of British Columbia’s top ballet companies, this eclectic production features a meticulous blend of contemporary and neoclassical works by Canada’s leading dance makers. The high-energy program will include: the thrilling tango-inspired Cuatro Estaciones, the mesmerizing Bolero, and vivacious audience favourite MAMBO. “It has been a few years since the Centre has hosted a large professional dance company like Ballet Kelowna,” says Darcy Campbell, director of LIVE @ the Centre. “These are two great shows to restart our season, and we are thrilled to welcome people back into our space.” […]"

Confederation Centre of the Arts is hosting auditions for Munschables, a family-friendly show that is back at The Charlottetown Festival by popular demand. The high-energy production brings the exciting and silly world of children’s author Robert Munsch to life through an interactive and musical performance. The show played at the Centre’s Outdoor Amphitheatre last summer and will return to the Festival with a new selection of stories from Munsch’s beloved books. The lively noon hour show will star an all-Islander cast, and auditions are open to non-equity Island-based performers between the ages of 16 and 30. “Our community is full of diverse young talent, and we are going to gather an exceptional group of Islanders to bring this new summer staple to life,” says Dawn Ward, the Festival’s associate artistic director. “We are looking for performers who can bring out their silly side, so the auditions will be a workshop that allows people to play off each other.” Ward will choreograph the show and co-direct with Adam Brazier, the Centre’s artistic director of performing arts. Auditions will take place on Saturday, December 10 […]"

Starting January 3, a unique piece from an Island artist will be raffled off each month via a limited number of $20 tickets.

P.E.I.’s housing crunch makes it challenging to find accommodations, and the Centre relies on the support of the community to welcome top-tier talent to the Island.

The Anne of Green Gables Manuscript: L.M. Montgomery and the Creation of Anne officially launched online today. The digital exhibition will allow people to explore Montgomery’s original text, see what was written on the back of pages, and find out how famous moments were developed or revised. The interactive website includes never-before-seen material, such as Montgomery’s publishing contract for the novel. “Visitors can pore over every pen stroke – there are bits of short story drafts and heavily scratched out passages that just beg for one to zoom in. We have also added hundreds of photo and video annotations to learn from,” says Dr. Emily Woster, an L.M. Montgomery scholar who curated the exhibition. “This is a celebration of Montgomery’s creative process, and we invite scholars and fans alike to explore the site and trace the origins of Anne.” The high-quality digitization of the manuscript gives visitors a unique opportunity to learn about the author and Prince Edward Island, and reflect on Anne’s legacy in print, on screen, and on stage – […]"

Now on view in the Frederic S. and Ogden Martin Concourse Gallery, It’s More Than Sports: A Celebration of BIPOC Athletes on Prince Edward Island features BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour) athletes from the past and present, with a glimpse into what sport could be in the future. Using historical photos and artifacts, contemporary photographs by Mi’kmaw photographer Patricia Bourque, drawings from Island children, and a vision statement for BIPOC sports on P.E.I., this exhibition draws attention to the often unacknowledged and powerful contribution of BIPOC peoples to the Island sporting community. It spotlights the numerous BIPOC athletes on the Island who have, and who continue to make, their communities proud, while also inspiring a new generation of BIPOC athletes to pursue their own dreams. The exhibition was coordinated and curated by Bianca Garcia and organized by BIPOC USHR, with support from the 2023 Canada Winter Games. “Although Prince Edward Island has a long history of BIPOC peoples competing in sports, their accomplishments rarely get the attention they deserve,” says Sobia Ali-Faisal, […]"

The paintings feature towering cedar trees that obstruct the view from a house. MacLean is a visual artist from the Island with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Her paintings and site-specific installations have been featured in Charlottetown’s Art in the Open Festival, the 2019 Confederation Centre Art Gallery exhibition Who’s Your Mother, and the 2013 Montreal group exhibition The Painting Project.

En juin, le Musée d’art du Centre de la Confédération (MACC) présentera Générations : la famille Sobey et l’art canadien, une exposition qui réunit des œuvres des premiers arrivants européens, des géants du vingtième siècle, une riche collection des Impressionnistes et des Automatistes du Québec ainsi que des artistes pionniers d’aujourd’hui, y compris des artistes autochtones contemporains. Cette exposition se compose d’œuvres des collections privées de la famille Sobey de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui se font les champions de l’art canadien depuis trois générations, en commençant dans les années 1960 et 1970 par la collection pionnière d’Irene et Frank H. Sobey. Cette exposition en tournée nationale a été organisée et mise en circulation par la McMichael Canadian Art Collection, et elle réunit les collections de la famille qui sont présentées au public pour la première fois. « Nous sommes emballés de présenter cette exposition de haut calibre à  Charlottetown et nous espérons accueillir de nombreux visiteurs, nouveaux et habituels, dit Kevin Rice, directeur du Musée.

Set in post-war Scotland, MAGGIE tells the inspirational tale of a fiery school cleaner living in the mining town of Lanarkshire. After suffering an unthinkable loss, she must rely on her strength, sense of humour, and fiercely loyal group of friends to raise her boys and protect them from the harsh and ever-changing world around them. The heartfelt show features a soul-stirring score by award-winning recording artist Johnny Reid, a Scot who immigrated to Canada as a teenager. The musical is based on the true story of his grandmother. Starring in the musical’s titular role is Dharma Bizier, a Sheridan graduate who has been involved with the production since 2018. Bizier went on to travel with Reid on his 2022 national tour, where she opened the concert with three songs from the musical. “The music comes from the heart, and you can tell that it was written with a lot of love for the characters and story,” says Bizier.

The show explores immigration and its impact on families, so Confederation Centre of the Arts is hosting We’re Canada Bound: Stories of Making a New Life in Canada – an interactive event where people can share their families’ stories.

The event will be hosted by Cameron MacDonald, the Centre’s heritage coordinator. “Many Islanders have experienced the complexities of the life-changing event of immigration,” he says. “Whether your ancestors arrived from Scotland on the  Alexander in 1772, or you have recently arrived from countries like India, Turkey, or Colombia, we invite you to come and share your family’s stories of migration, hope, and resilience.” There are two opportunities to participate […]"

The Centre previously announced that Islanders Graham Putnam, Aaron Ryder, and Dawn Ward-Dames will be starring in the show. Festival alumni Jay Davis, Jeremy Legat, and Sweeney MacArthur are set to join them. Cast members making their Festival debut include Jamie McRoberts and Julius Sermonia. The play is directed by Herbie Barnes, an accomplished playwright, performer, director, and arts educator whose 30-year-career spans stages across North America.

CCAG is thrilled to be bringing the exhibition Generations: The Sobey Family and Canadian Art to Charlottetown this summer.

Organized and circulated by McMichael Canadian Art Collection and curated by Sarah Milroy, Generations is on view from June 10 – September 10.

The lively cabaret from Kitbag Theatre features lots of Island talent. It stars powerhouse duo Jacob Hemphill and Melissa MacKenzie, with direction from Rebecca Parent. Accompanied by a rockstar band (Josh Langille, Sam Langille, Logan Richard), the show is full of hit songs like “Jackson”, “Folsom Prison Blues”, and “Ring of Fire”. “While I’ve always had a passion for Johnny Cash’s music, it was the steadfast love that he and June […]"

The production will feature 98 students from the Centre’s dance umbrella program and 24 members of PEISO led by the Island’s own Dale Sorensen, a long-standing musician at PEISO and The Charlottetown Festival, and chair of the Department of Music at the University of Prince Edward Island.

Becoming Dolly is a new production that Gallant will debut at Confederation Centre of the Arts. “Bringing a show I created to The Charlottetown Festival is something beyond my wildest dreams,” says Gallant. “Dolly Parton is a symbol of authenticity, generosity, and power; I’m thrilled to be exploring her stories […]"

Written and performed by Islander Justin Shaw, 70 Mile Yard Sale shares a story about a madcap journey across the Island to retrieve a lost family heirloom. Equal parts funny and heartfelt, this tall tale is about family, friendship, and finding more than what you bargained for. Shaw is a comedian and storyteller who has performed at JFL42 at Just For Laughs Toronto, appeared on Mike Birbiglia’s Working It Out comedy show, opened for Fortune Feimster, and tours regularly with Yuk Yuk’s. As a comedy writer, he has written for Feast Dinner Theatres and presented solo shows across Canada, with his work being featured on his TV series Tales From Island Boy on Bell FibeTV1. Island audiences may remember Shaw from his work in Culture Shock with Lorne Elliot.

Ce cours stimulant est idéal pour les débutants et les artistes intermédiaires qui souhaitent perfectionner leurs techniques de dessin dans une ambiance chaleureuse et créative. La séance débute par des exercices d'échauffement légers avant de passer au dessin de natures mortes à partir de sujets réels. Plutôt que de se concentrer sur la précision, cet atelier vous encourage à vous détendre, à gagner en confiance dans votre trait et à apprécier le processus attentif d'observation de ce que vous dessinez. Tout le matériel artistique, y compris les marqueurs, les pastels, le fusain et les crayons, est fourni. Les participants sont également invités à apporter leur propre matériel. Vous pouvez même apporter un petit objet personnel à intégrer à la nature morte, rendant ainsi votre œuvre unique et personnelle. Si vous recherchez des cours d'art amusants et inspirants à Charlottetown ou ailleurs à l'Î.-P.-É., cet atelier de dessin est un excellent point de départ."

Tout le matériel artistique, y compris les marqueurs, les pastels, le fusain et les crayons, est fourni. Les participants sont également invités à apporter leur propre matériel. Vous pouvez même apporter un petit objet personnel à ajouter à la nature morte, rendant ainsi votre œuvre unique et personnelle. Si vous recherchez des cours d'art amusants et inspirants à Charlottetown ou ailleurs à l'Î.-P.-É., cet atelier de dessin est un excellent point de départ.

Ce cours stimulant est idéal pour les débutants et les artistes intermédiaires qui souhaitent perfectionner leurs techniques de dessin dans une ambiance chaleureuse et créative. La séance débute par des exercices d'échauffement légers avant de passer au dessin de natures mortes à partir de sujets réels. Plutôt que de se concentrer sur la précision, cet atelier vous encourage à vous détendre, à gagner en confiance dans votre trait et à apprécier le processus attentif d'observation de ce que vous dessinez. Tout le matériel artistique, y compris les marqueurs, les pastels, le fusain et les crayons, est fourni. Les participants sont également invités à apporter leur propre matériel. Vous pouvez même apporter un petit objet personnel à ajouter à la nature morte, rendant ainsi votre œuvre unique et personnelle. Si vous recherchez des cours d'art amusants et inspirants à Charlottetown ou ailleurs à l'Î.-P.-É., cet atelier de dessin est un excellent point de départ.

Chorale de mineurs de charbon à la retraite, ils préservent et célèbrent un mode de vie unique, partageant les chansons et les histoires qu'ils ont vécues de première main. Pour les fêtes, les hommes sont de retour avec vos classiques réinventés préférés, de toutes nouvelles pièces originales de leur album December Coal Christmas et des histoires qui vous feront vibrer le cœur et l'esprit. La chanteuse et artiste invitée spéciale Jenn Sheppard se joint aux joyeux mineurs sur scène, accompagnée de son alter ego à l'esprit vif, Ellsa, qui apporte la touche parfaite de chaos de Noël grincheux. Venez pour la musique. Restez pour les histoires. Ce n'est pas seulement un concert, c'est une connexion. « Le concert le plus incroyable auquel j'aie jamais assisté ! » — Sandra M., Guysborough (N.-É.) « Le meilleur spectacle que j'ai vu depuis longtemps ! Tellement talentueux ! J'ai savouré chaque minute.

Le premier acte donne vie à toute la beauté, la grâce et l'émerveillement du ballet classique, avec la musique emblématique de Tchaïkovski, des flocons de neige tourbillonnants et le malicieux Roi des souris. Puis, la scène se métamorphose pour le deuxième acte, qui s'anime d'une chorégraphie inédite et d'une touche de modernité. Mêlant hip-hop, danse contemporaine et styles inspirés par la communauté, ce spectacle revisité célèbre la créativité et la diversité de la scène de danse de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard. Avec une chorégraphie éblouissante, un récit captivant et une énergie juvénile, Casse-Noisette : La Magie Réinventée est une fusion joyeuse de tradition et d'innovation. Idéal pour les familles et les spectateurs de tous âges, ce spectacle des Fêtes inspirant vous réchauffera le cœur, stimulera votre imagination et mettra en lumière l'incroyable talent des jeunes artistes de Dance Umbrella.

Huit acrobates de renommée mondiale explorent l'habileté physique&nbsp;: comment l'acquérir, comment la perfectionner et comment elle peut transformer nos vies.

Au fil de leurs plaisanteries, un orchestre complet donne vie à leur imagination au son de musiques tirées de certaines des musiques les plus appréciées d'Hollywood. Créée par Jaelem Bhate, chef d'orchestre-compositeur primé et directeur musical de l'Orchestre symphonique de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard, cette production transgenre reprend des thèmes emblématiques de Harry Potter, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Titanic, Pirates des Caraïbes, Avengers, et bien d'autres. Chaque moment musical s'intègre au récit, soulignant l'arc émotionnel, ajoutant des punchlines et touchant l'âme. Intelligent, drôle et étonnamment émouvant, Once Upon a Score célèbre le cinéma, la créativité et le pouvoir universel du récit. Que vous soyez cinéphile, mélomane ou simplement quelqu'un qui a déjà cherché sa propre voie créative, ce spectacle unique, à mi-chemin entre concert et théâtre, vous fera rire, réfléchir et peut-être même vous inspirera à écrire votre propre histoire.

Durée : 1 h 30 (sans entracte). « Come From Away » est inspiré de l'histoire vraie d'une petite ville qui a accueilli le monde entier. Ce qui avait commencé comme une journée ordinaire à Gander, à Terre-Neuve, a basculé dans l'histoire lorsque 38 avions transportant des milliers de personnes y ont été déroutés le 11 septembre 2001. Les cultures se sont heurtées et la tension était palpable, mais la communauté de la côte Est a accueilli ces « étrangers » à bras ouverts ; l'inquiétude a fait place à la confiance et la gratitude a donné naissance à des amitiés indéfectibles. « Come From Away » raconte une histoire touchante de bienveillance face à des circonstances exceptionnelles. Livret, musique et paroles d'Irene Sankoff et David Hein. Présenté en accord avec Music Theatre International (MTI).

Her life was transformed by her transition to living as a woman in the mid-1970s, and by her permanent move to Prince Edward Island in 1985 – which she described as a homecoming.   The myriad of periods of Rutherford’s life and career will be explored at Confederation Centre Art Gallery this summer with the exhibition Erica Rutherford: […]"

        "@value": "Gallery Blog Over the next few months, we’re in conversation with artists, curators, and others regarding our current exhibitions at the Confederation Centre Art Gallery.  This week, we chat with Sarah Swan, a curator and writer based in Yellowknife, about her role in curating the Yellowknife Forever! exhibition, a collaborative show featuring the work of seven artists. The exhibition is at the Gallery until Oct 13th, 2024.   As the “Yellowknife Forever!” exhibition demonstrates, perceptions of the NWT often contrast realities. In what ways did showcasing the unique works of seven artists align with the complexities and varieties of Northern lives and experiences?   SS: Many geographical locations deal with stereotypes and the expectations of tourists, but perhaps especially PEI, and, I think, especially the North. Maybe people who visit PEI want a certain kind of pastoral beauty, they want bucolic, they want the feeling of childhood and innocence. I mean, it’s not Vegas, right? Emotionally and psychologically, people who visit the North want a rugged, pristine, “last frontier” experience. The local art market tends to perpetuate these romantic ideals.

It also includes a short film, A Building of Destiny, which was produced by Parks Canada in collaboration with the Mi’kmaq Confederacy of PEI.

Crews continued their work removing paving stones and planters from the south plaza area next to the former library space. This is where the Centre will build a new stage-sized rehearsal hall that will support the creation and development of new work, and will provide much-needed, medium-sized meeting space in downtown Charlottetown. The temporary fencing on Queen Street that allowed for the safe removal of the concrete has been disassembled, and the parking spaces it occupied are now open. Demolition also continued inside the former library space. There will be major changes to the inside of the building that will make way for new interpretive spaces that explore the history of our country and the continued evolution of Confederation, as well as new arts education and activity spaces.

The musical full of East Coast pride delighted audiences when it made its world premiere at The 2022 Charlottetown Festival and completed a cross-province tour of Newfoundland and Labrador. Since then, the musical has been workshopped by its creative team for a return in 2025. Once its summer run at The 2025 Charlottetown Festival concludes, Tell Tale Harbour will make its mainland debut in Toronto with co-producers David and Hannah Mirvish. Further details will be announced at a later date. “The Charlottetown Festival has a long history of producing new Canadian musicals, and an important part of that process is to revisit works to help them evolve so that they can be shared on stages across the country,” says Adam Brazier, the Centre’s artistic director of performing arts and one of the co-creators of Tell Tale Harbour. “The 2025 version of this musical is the same story audiences fell in love with, but the entire world has been reimagined with new characters, additional songs, more dancing, and fresh set and costume designs.” The […]"

At the centre of this evolution is the creation of Canada’s first cultural leadership institute focused on facilitating dialogue about important issues in Canada and strengthening Confederation through learning. The $71.5 million Shared Voices Campaign seeks support from Canadians coast to coast to coast to bring this ambitious vision to life. Funded in part by the governments of Canada and Prince Edward Island, the project will expand the Centre’s role in helping Canadians explore important issues shaping the country, while facilitating the expansion of arts education programs and new work development through rejuvenated spaces. “This is about re-building connections across Canada,” says Centre CEO Steve Bellamy. “Confederation Centre was created in 1964 as the national memorial to the leaders who worked at connecting the provinces together as a country. Today, we’re building on that legacy by renewing these spaces where Canadians can come together to discuss the issues that matter most to our nation’s future, and to learn about […]"

March is recognized as the month of the Francophonie around the world. Throughout the month, the French language and francophone culture is celebrated by Acadians, Francophones, Canadians, and Francophiles across the country and the province. In collaboration with La Fédération culturelle de l’Île-du-Prince-Édouard (FCÎPÉ), le Carrefour de l’Isle-Saint-Jean, Francofolies de Charlottetown, and Festival Route 11, Confederation Centre of the Arts will host two events on Saturday, March 1 to celebrate Mardi Gras and RVF. A Mardi Gras mask making workshop will take place in the afternoon to embrace the centuries-old tradition of the holiday; New Orleans’ Mardi Gras is considered the biggest masked party in North America. Later that evening, a concert will take place at The Mack with performances from Acadian folk music group Vishtèn, and Louisiana Cajun artists Danser Collé featuring Roddie Romero. “We are honoured to partner with these organizations to co-host the launch of RVF, and to work closely with the community to bring quality francophone programming to the Island.

Last year, the Centre conducted a community engagement survey that showed the need to do more to engage with two groups in particular; people under 40, and people who are new to the Island. As one response to these findings, the Centre recently asked a few young leaders in the community to put together a youth advisory board (YAB) of people under 30 who would be interested in helping Confederation Centre of the Arts connect with more youth. The resulting board of ten will meet quarterly with management and provide advice and guidance on connecting the Centre to a younger adult population. They will report to the CEO and board of directors about various initiatives, and will help promote awareness and engagement of Centre programming, particularly among the members’ peers. “We are excited to introduce this dynamic group of young voices from Prince Edward Island who are dedicated to helping the Centre shape its future,” says Centre CEO Steve Bellamy. “With their diverse perspectives and creative ideas, they will play a vital role in ensuring […]"

That includes the removal and demolition of things like non-load-bearing walls, Gyproc, flooring, air ducts, plumbing, and anything else not connected to the structural integrity of the building.  Structural demolition is ongoing. Two large sections of concrete floor are being removed from the centre block of the building. This will allow for the construction of a new street-level entrance and lobby that will create a far more inviting and accessible space to enter the building. Also, the inserts between the centre and east blocks, and the centre and west blocks of the building are being demolished to make way for new inserts that will allow more natural light into the space.  As you can see, the demolition of these structural inserts is painstaking work. In these photos you can see workers lifting just one slab of concrete off the roof of the insert. This process will be repeated many times. But the end result will be worth it…  There is also significant new construction taking place on-site. Structural steel has been installed in the east […]"

Richard grew up looking different than other Indigenous children, but his mother continually reminded him that he was part of the Creator’s plan and empowered him to embrace his culture, no matter what he looked like. Performed by the Mi’kmaq Heritage Actors, this story of encouragement and identity is told in an interactive show for all ages. Developed with support from TD Ready […]"

Festival company members Frankie Cottrell, Connor Lucas, and Kale Penny will take on the parts of rock and roll legends Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins in Million Dollar Quartet.

Under the baton of PEISO Music Director Jaelem Bhate, the orchestra will bring to life the beloved themes of “The Imperial March”, “Across the Stars”, “Battle of the Heroes”, “Duel of the Fates”, “Princess Leia’s Theme”, and more. In recognition of the role that classical music played to inspire John Williams in his composition of these seminal soundtracks, the PEISO will perform excerpts of parallel classical works, including pieces by Tchaikovsky, Strauss, and Stravinsky. “This concert is pure fun and musical brilliance rolled into one,” says Bhate. “The music of Star Wars and John Williams is a masterclass in orchestral storytelling, and pairing it with the classical works that inspired them offers a fresh way to experience this music.

Forum speakers include Nora Young, CBC tech journalist and broadcaster; Drew Fagan, professor and public policy advisor; Sabreena Delhon, CEO of the Samara Centre for Democracy; Stephanie Arnold, climate specialist at CLIMAtlantic; and Dr. Megan Miller, palliative care and MAiD physician, and former chief physician recruiter for P.E.I.  Also included on the Forum’s agenda are poetic responses from P.E.I. Poet Laureate Tanya Davis, a performance from the River Clyde Pageant, and a private tour of exhibitions at Confederation Centre Art Gallery.   “Whether you are passionate about social change, intrigued by the role of art in public dialogue, or simply looking for thought-provoking discussions, the Charlottetown Forum turns discussions into experiences […]"

What started as an average day in Gander, Newfoundland turned into a historic moment when 38 planes carrying thousands of people were diverted there on September 11, 2001. Cultures clashed and nerves ran high, but the East Coast community welcomed these “come from aways” into their lives with open arms; uneasiness turned into trust, and gratitude grew into enduring friendships. Come From Away tells a heartwarming story of kindness in the face of unprecedented circumstances.  This Maritime production of Come From Away is co-produced with Neptune Theatre in Halifax, NS.   “Since its premiere in 2015, Come From Away has been the most-requested show by Islanders and we are so excited to finally present it at the Festival. We are thrilled to be partnering with another Atlantic Canadian theatre to share a story that celebrates home and the best of humankind,” says Adam Brazier, artistic director of performing arts at Confederation Centre […]"

Construction is set to be moved off Victoria Row by Monday, June 23 to allow visitors to enjoy restaurant patios and live music throughout the summer. Removal of exterior wall sandstone panels is complete, which will make room for additions such as the new rehearsal hall and bump outs on either side of the entrance. Construction is ongoing for two new foundations that will add additional levels to the structure, creating four floors. Progress will soon be made on transitional spaces, like stairs and an elevator to different levels, as well as a solar chimney to allow natural light into the building. The new rehearsal hall will include an elevator, making the space more accessible. Mass timber arrived in PEI to create structure for the new additions to the building. Choosing timber is a sustainable choice over standard steel, played a major role in the project’s goal to achieve net-zero emissions. Assembly of the timber is well underway.

Meanwhile, in the former library space, the interior wall steel stud installation is well underway. The new 1st, 4th, and 5th floors were completed in September, and teams are now focused on finishing the 2nd and 3rd floors this month. We’ll continue to share updates as major milestones are reached. Stay tuned for photos, site insights, and progress reports through the fall."
